# How to enforce password complexity in XAF
This example shows how to validate passwords in XAF apps.

## Implementation Details

The easiest way to accomplish this task is to create a dedicated validation rule with [Model Editor](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112582/concepts/application-model/model-editor) that cheks all new passwords with a regex expression.
For additional information, refer to the following help topic [Validate Password Complexity](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/401909/validation/validate-password-complexity)
